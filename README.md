Snake
===

This is a JavaScript version of the classic arcade game snake.  There are three classes that form the underlining game (apple.js, board.js, and snake.js).  I wanted to keep these classes clean of user interaction.  To actually play game, I made a snake_ui.js, which handles the game loop and rendering HTML.
